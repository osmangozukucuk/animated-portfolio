# React + Vite Project Template

Welcome to the React + Vite project template. This template is designed to kickstart your React development with a modern, fast, and powerful build tool, Vite.

## Features

- **React**: This template uses React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows you to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.

- **Vite**: Vite provides a lean and fast development server with features like hot module replacement (HMR). HMR allows you to see your changes in the browser instantly without a full page refresh, significantly improving the development experience.

- **ESLint**: The project is pre-configured with a set of ESLint rules. ESLint is a tool that helps to enforce code style and find code issues. This helps to maintain a consistent code style and reduces the likelihood of common mistakes.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, clone the repository and install the dependencies with your package manager of choice.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
npm install
